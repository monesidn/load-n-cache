# Load 'n' Cache
* Read it like "Rock 'n' roll" or "Lock 'n' load" *

This is a simple library that i initially wrote while working on a large AngularJS application to make it easier to perform an async resource load and then cache the result until something happened. It started as a simple aid to store user informations for 10 minutes but then it become a corner stone of the project. 

Being this useful i thought it was a pity not to make it public and available for today javascript frameworks so i decided to rewrite it from scratch and make it freely available.

## The problem 
As any other library this one solves a common problem, load a resource, the result of a REST service for instance, and make it available for subsequent calls without calling the service again or impacting calling code. Check the following code as an example of what NOT TO DO.

```javascript
var user;

function getUser() {
    function loadUser() {
        return fetch('/myself').then(u => user = u);
    }

    if (!user){
        loadUser();
    }
    return user;
}
```
The code above is loosely based on something i found in a production environment and has a lot of problems:
    1. Invoking getUser() multiple times before the call to /myself completes results in multiple calls to the backend.
    1. You can never be sure if user is undefined because the backend did not worked or it's not loaded yet.
You can improve this code using promises but as you take more scenarios into account and more handling gets harder.

## A simple yet powerful solution
This library solves the above problems in a very easy-to-write way:

```javascript
var user = new LoadNCache(() => fetch('/myself'));

function getUser() {
    return user.get();
}

```
The LoadNCache object will take care of:
    * Call the provided "loadFunction" the first time the `get()` method is called;
    * call the function again if the cached value is invalidated (e.g. for an explicit call to `.flush()` or the configured "autoflush" occurred);
    * always return the original promise, this mean that it is immediatly resolved if the value was already fetched;
    * returning the same promise also mean that you can `.catch()` the error multiple times from different callers;
    * emit events upon status changes. You need to update something when a new value is fetched? Just listen for the `'fethced'` event.

## In depth Documentation
LoadNCache is a class that is only responsible for calling a "loadFunction" at the right moment and storing the returned value for the future. Each class instance can be configured to work in a different way so each data is stored in the right way. For example the following are all use cases that can be esily implemented using LoadNCache:
    * Load user data and store them for up to 10 minutes.
    * Load action available and store them on localStorage so after refreshing the page data are not downloaded again.
    * Perform some CPU intensive task and store the result to avoid computing the value again.
    * Load a short-lived value from the server only if it is actually needed, like the server date and time. 

### What is a "loadFunction"?
As the names goes it is a javascript function responsible for loading the data that are going to be stored. It may return a primitive value, an object or a promise, so also async functions are welcome. There are no constraints on how the value can obtained. 
The return value of the loadFunction is handled as follows
    * if it is "undefined" it is wrapped into a rejected promise and stored;
    * if it is null or any other value, expect for Thenable object, it is wrapped into a resolved promise and stored;
    * If it is a "thenable object", so it does have a `.then()` method, the value is stored as is.
The loadFunction should be stateless as it may be called immediatly, in the future or never. 

So when the loadFunction is called? Anytime a new value needs to be retrieved. This usually happen after a call to the .get() method if no cached value is available.

### LoadNCache API
#### Constructor
The LoadNCache constructor accept an options object. If default options are ok for you then you can pass in a function. Passing a function is the same as passing only the loader option in the options parameter.

##### Options
* *loader: () => any*: the loadFunction. This is the only option that must be provided.
* *disableEvents: boolean*: don't want events to be dispathed? Set this to true. Defaults to false.
* *autoFlushTime: number*: how long (in millis) the value should be kept. As soon as time elapsed an automatic call to .flush() is executed. Setting it to 0 or a negative value disable this feature. Defaults to 0.
* *persist: string*: there are 3 supported values:
    * *localStorage*: the promise result is serialized as JSON and stored into localStorage. You must provide a storageKey option to specify the name of the localStorage key.
    * *sessionStorage*: the promise result is serialized as JSON and stored into sessionStorage. You must provide a storageKey option to specify the name of the sessionStorage key.
    * *none*: the value is stored in-memory. Refreshing the page or restarting the application will reset the state.
* *persistKey: string*: if persisting on a key-value storage (like localStorage or sessionStorage) this option specify the key to use to store data.

#### .get()
Retrieve the value. Always returns a promise. This call may result in the loadFunction being called but is up to the instance to decide whatever this should happen or not.

#### .flush()
Invalidate the currently cached value if any. If no value is cached then this method does nothing. Each subsequent call to `.get()` will get a different promise object then before. 

#### .refresh()
Shortcut for calling `.flush()` and `.get()`. Returns the promise from .get().

### LoadNCache events
You are able to react to status changes listening to the following events:
* *beforeLoad*: the instance is about to call the loadFunction to fetch a new promise. No promise currently cached.
* *afterLoad*: the instance has called the loaderFunction and a new promise is available. This event doesn't wait for the promise to resolve.
* *beforeFlush*: someone called the .flush() method. This is your last chance to do something before the current promise is removed and a new one will be created.
* *afterFlush*: the old promise was removed. No promise currently cached.
Each event is emitted with the LoadNCache instance as argument.

## Dependancies
This library was meant to have as few dependancies as possibile. Currently it only depends on an EventEmitter implementation. I choosed not to use the node.js implementation because is not available on browsers.
Also be sure that Promises are supported by your target platform both natively or using a polyfill.

## Recipes
### Load user data and store them for up to 10 minutes.

```javascript
class UserService{
    constructor(){
        this._user = new LoadNCache({
           loader: () => fetch('/myself'),
           autoFlushTime: 10 * 60 * 1000
        });
    }

    getUser(){
        return this._user.get();
    }
}

```

### Load action available and store them on localStorage.
```javascript
class PrivilegeService{
    constructor(){
        this._roles = new LoadNCache({
           loader: () => fetch('/roles'),
           persist: 'localStorage',
           persistKey: 'security-roles'
        });
    }

    hasRole(role){
        return this._roles.get().then(r => !!r.find(i => role === i));
    }
}
```

### Perform some CPU intensive task and store the result to avoid computing the value again.
```javascript
function heavyJob(){
    return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
}

let heavyJobResult = new LoadNCache(heavyJob);
```


### Load a short-lived value from the server.
```javascript 
class TimeService{
    constructor(){
        this._serverTime = new LoadNCache({
           loader: () => fetch('/api/current-time').then(t => new Date(parseInt(t))),
           autoFlushTime: 5000
        });
    }

    getServerTime(Ã¬){
        return this._serverTime.get();
    }
}
```
